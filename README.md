# Probablistic-Wind-Speed-Modeling
This project involves the probabilistic modeling of wind speed data for wind power assessment purposes. The Weibull, Gamma, Lognormal, and Rayleigh probability distributions were used to model the data as recommended by the literature.
The Maximum Likelihood Method (MLM) was used to estimate the parameters of these distributions.
RMSE, RÂ², MAE, BIC, AIC, and KS statistic were used to choose the fittest model.
